In the development process, a robust system was implemented to ensure the seamless recording of data entered into the fields of the JSP (JavaServer Pages) file. Specifically, a dedicated database was established to securely store and manage the information collected from these fields.

Moreover, recognizing the importance of file management, a separate database was incorporated to handle the storage of files attached to the system. This dual-database approach ensures the organized and efficient handling of both textual data and attached files, providing a comprehensive solution for data management within the application. With this implementation, the system is well-equipped to maintain the integrity and accessibility of both types of information, contributing to an enhanced user experience.
